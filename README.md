# Cats and Dogs Classification Repository
### Overview
Welcome to the Cats and Dogs Classification Repository! This project is focused on leveraging the power of deep learning to accurately classify images of cats and dogs. By employing the renowned VGG16 model, a convolutional neural network architecture, we aim to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between these two popular pets.

### Model Overview: VGG16
The VGG16 model is a deep convolutional network developed by the Visual Graphics Group at Oxford (hence 'VGG'). It's known for its simplicity and depth, featuring 16 convolutional layers. This model has been pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, making it an excellent choice for image classification tasks due to its robust feature extraction capabilities.

### Dataset
Our model is trained on a large dataset of labeled images of cats and dogs. This dataset provides a diverse range of images in terms of breeds, poses, and environments, ensuring that our model learns to recognize these animals in various contexts.

### Implementation
*Data Preprocessing*: Images are resized and normalized to fit the input requirements of the VGG16 model.

*Model Architecture*: We utilize the pre-trained VGG16 model, with custom layers added to tailor it for our binary classification task (cats vs. dogs).

*Training*: The model is trained using a split of training and validation data, ensuring it learns effectively and generalizes well.

*Evaluation*: Performance is assessed using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

*Results*
Our final model demonstrates excellent performance, with high accuracy in classifying images of cats and dogs. Detailed results including confusion matrices and accuracy/loss curves are available in the 'Results' section.

### Usage
Instructions for setting up the environment, loading the dataset, training the model, and evaluating its performance are provided in detail under the 'Usage' section.
